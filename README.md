# dynamicApi
#This project is a dynamic API that provides JWT-based authentication and authorization, supporting the creation and management of modules, permissions, and user groups. It enables secure API endpoints using JWT tokens and checks permissions dynamically based on group memberships. The API allows for the creation of modules and their associated permissions, group management, and the assignment of permissions to both modules and groups. Users can be assigned to groups, and middleware ensures authorization checks based on permissions before performing actions on modules. It includes comprehensive error handling, logging, data validation, and security best practices to ensure robustness and scalability.
